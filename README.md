# image_selector_app

I frequently find myself in the situation where I want to modify *some* but not *all* images in a directory.  Interactively building out the shell script can be pretty annoying.  I'm generally not into "vibe coding" but decided to give it a try today, and after a bit of back-and-forth it basically gave me what I wanted.

My specific use case here is making thumbnails of images, but the directory I'm drawing from includes lots of extra images I *don't* want to make thumbnails of.
